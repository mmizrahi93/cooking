# Welcome to CookBook

My goal was to make a full stack application in which people can post there recipes for others to look at and enjoy too. The first page is the index page in which people can scroll and view images of peoples recipes. At the top there is also a button for creating a new post. When clicking on an image on the index page, it brings you to the show page of that recipe.  On the show page it gives you the name of the recipe, inspiration behind the recipe, an image, the ingredients needed, and how to make it. At the bottom of the show page it has an edit recipe button in which people can use to fix any changes on their recipes. There is also a delete button to delete your post. I also made it mobile friendly.
